
# Abstract:
# There are many classes in this file
# Each class represent a type of chess piece
# They have the same variables and the same methods
# But different codes within those methods
# Thi way the game can check the moves of the pieces
# By calling the same methods on different objects

# This entire game will probably take a long time to finish


"""
FAQ:


Q: Why so many classes in one file?
A: I was intended to code every chess piece class in a separate file,
   but then realized Python can contain multiple classes in one .py file.


Q: Why not make all the classes into a package?
A: It's a pain since classes outside the package might have
   different namespaces due to difference in import.
   (Or it's just that I haven't figure out about "mutual imports" yet.)


Q: How do these classes work?
A: The first class(ChessPiece) is the super class, which every type
   of chess piece will inherent from, thus it contains attributes and
   methods that all chess pieces will share in common.
   The rest are all subclasses of the ChessPiece class, which each of them
   will contain same methods, but with different code(logic) implemented
   within the methods.
